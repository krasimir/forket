<h1 align="center">êÇê Forket - the RSC support without a framework</h1>

Forket is a tool that splits your code to client and server so you have [RSC (React Server Components)](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) working without a framework.

* [Examples/templates](#examplestemplates)

## Examples/Templates

* esbuild / [Basic code snippets](./examples/basic/) - app that covers the examples from the [official server components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) docs.
* esbuild / [Image annotator](./examples/annotation-app/) - a little bit more complicated app for annotating pictures
* Vite / [Inspirational quote generator](./examples/vite/) - generates inspirational quote
* Webpack / [Inspirational quote generator](./examples/webpack/) - generates inspirational quote
* [CLI](./examples/just-cli) - No app really. Just Forket doing its magic.

## Caveats

I'm quite happy with the result so far. The libarry is supporting almost everything that is listed into the official docs. However, to make all this work at a decent level I had to make some compromises. Here's the list:

* You can‚Äôt have nester client boundaries or in other words nested islands.
* There is an additional `div` with `display: content` for the root client components. So, no effect on your layout but there may be problems with some CSS selectors.
* The server‚Äôs entry point also need to be processed by Forket. This means that it needs to be inside the `src` directory. Usually that's the case but who knows.
* There must be at least one file in the root directory with ‚Äúuse client‚Äù directive. Forket need to inject some client-side utilities in order to operate.
* The client entry points (the components that have ‚Äúuse client‚Äù need to default export a component)
